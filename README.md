# Circuit Pitfall
Pitfall! for Adafruit's Circuit Playground

## Status
Pre-alpha development.  Code should run on a Circuit Playground express, but definitely is not a game (yet).

## Goals

* A completely playable Pitfall game running on a stock Circuit Playground Express.
* The linear room scrolling gameplay is represented as circular on the CP LED's.
* Every object, room and level in the game represented in its proper location.
* Coded using only base Arduino C and the CircuitPlayground library.
* When practical, use binary numbers and operators.
* Keep the overall code lean, simple and fast, especially using minimal memory to store game state.
